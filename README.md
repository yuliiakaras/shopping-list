# Angular Shopping List Project

## Overview

This project is an Angular application that allows users to manage a shopping list. Users can create, update, delete, and view product details. Each product has attributes such as name, description, price, and tags. The main page displays a shopping list with tags above it, and a form to create new products below.

## Main Features

- Create new products with a user-friendly form.
- View a list of all products with essential details.
- Edit product fields (name, description, price and tags (for tags separate words with space or coma ))
- Delete products with a single click.
- Filter products by tags.
- Tags are dynamic, so only user created tags are presented.
